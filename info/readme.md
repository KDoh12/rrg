# Red River Gorge 

This is where I will talk a little bit about Red River Gorge!

## Red River Gorge Facts

1. In the 1960s, a proposal was made to build a dam in RRG but was dismissed after protestors staged a protest hike which eventually led to RRG being registered as a National Natural Landmark.

2. Red River Gorge is home to the Virgina Big-Eared Bat, the Indiana Bat and the Red Cockaded Woodpecker; all three of which are endangered animals.
